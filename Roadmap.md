## V2.0 Roadmap
- Kitra should be able to boot and shutdown artik given certain events (Artik can stay powered down for best power consumption, and botted only when needed)
- Improvements of the Kitra sleep commands
- Better microphone events
- New proxity gestures events (ex. up/down)
- watchdog commands
